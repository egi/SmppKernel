# SmppKernel

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/egi/SmppKernel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/egi/SmppKernel)

This package is still incomplete. Please wait until it is usable before we decided to submit to packagist.
In the meantime, I use it in our internal project via composer, as follow:

- add vcs repositori

  ```
  {
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://github.com/egi/SmppKernel",
  }
  ```

- require

  ```
     "egi\SmppKernel": "trunk@dev",
  ```
